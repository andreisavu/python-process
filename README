Python Killable Process
-----------------------

Code wrote by Benjamin Smedberg and Peter Astrand. Excellent work guys! 

"Iâ€™ve managed, at long last, to solve the problem of launching subprocesses from python. 
I have created a python module which can launch a subprocess, wait for the process with a 
timeout, and kill that process and all of its sub-subprocesses correctly, on Windows, Mac, 
and Linux. Source code is here. It requires python 2.4+ because it subclasses the subprocess 
module. On Windows, it only works on Win2k+, and it requires the ctypes module, which comes 
with Python 2.5+, or can be installed into earlier versions of Python."
